          <h1>AMP Dashboard</h1>
          <p>Geo-Instruments monitors all of their projects through a central application, to view project status, alerts, users and configuration. Before this application was replatformed I took the original monolithic PHP application and overhauled the user interface.</p>

      <h2>Problem:</h2>
      <p>
        The need here was to update the user interface to include clearer navigation, and alarm visualization. Also the user experience was in need of an update, 
        the existing application was not responsive outside of the desktop so work had to be done to remake the frontend markup architecture and css.

          <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
          <p> 
            The existing frontend was built on top of a monolithic PHP application. Adding my own HTML and CSS to the existing PHP required a very careful process, since I did not want to break the existing logic.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Identifying a solution</h3>
          <p>Once a process for refactoring and adding to the existing frontend code was in place I was able to begin my work of adding Bootstrap CSS, and responsive interface features. The existing tables had to be completely rebuilt using Bootstrap Css.</p>
